# Java-Projects

This repository contains various Java-based projects created by me during my learning journey in Computer Science. The projects range from simple console applications to more complex systems, showcasing various concepts and techniques in Java programming.

## Project 1: University Management System

### Overview

The **University Management System** is a console-based application built in Java. It provides functionalities for managing university data, including students, faculty members, and courses. The system allows users to add, update, delete, and view information about students, faculty, and courses.

### Features

- **Add Student**: Allows the user to add new students with details such as name, ID, department, and completed credits.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students, showing their information.
- **Add Faculty**: Enables the user to add faculty members with details such as name, ID, and specialization.
- **View Faculties**: Displays a list of all faculty members.
- **Add Course**: Allows the user to add new courses by specifying the course title and code.
- **View Courses**: Displays all the courses added to the system.
- **Update Student**: Allows the user to update a student's information based on their ID.
- **Delete Student**: Enables the user to delete a student's record from the system.
- **Search Student**: Allows the user to search for a student by their ID.
- **Update Faculty**: Enables the user to update faculty details.
- **Delete Faculty**: Allows the user to delete a faculty member.
- **Search Faculty**: Allows the user to search for a faculty member by their ID.

### Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for this project.
- **Collections**: Used `ArrayList` to store student, faculty, and course data.
